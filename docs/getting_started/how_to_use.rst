Using the Scenario File
*************************************************

For the modeling and optimization of an energy system, parameters for all system components must be given in the model 
generator using the enclosed .xlsx file (editable with Excel, LibreOffice, â€¦). The .xlsx file is divided into nine 
input sheets. In the "energysystem" sheet, general parameters are defined for the time horizon to be examined, in the 
sheets "buses", "sinks", "sources", "transformers", "storages" and "links" corresponding components are defined. In 
the sheet "time series", the performance of individual components can be stored. In the "weather data" sheet, the 
required weather data is stored. When completing the input file, it is recommended to enter the energy system step by 
step and to perform test runs in between, so that potential input errors are detected early and can be localized more 
easily. In addition to the explanation of the individual input sheets, an example energy system is built step by step 
in the following subchapters. The input file for this example is stored in the program folder "examples" and viewed on 
`GitHub <https://github.com/chrklemm/SESMG/tree/master/examples>`_. The following units are used throughout:

- capacity/performance in kW,
- energy in kWh,
- angles in degrees, and
- costs in cost units (CU).

Cost units are any scalable quantity used to optimize the energy system, such as euros or grams of carbon dioxide emissions.


Energysystem
=================================================

Within this sheet, the time horizon and the temporal resolution of the model is defined. The following parameters have to be entered:

- **start date**: Start of the modelling time horizon. Format: "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss";
- **end date**: End date of the modelling time horizon. Format: "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss"; and

Links
=================================================

Within this sheet, the links of the energy system are defined. The following parameters have 
to be entered:

- **label**: Unique designation of the link. The following format is recommended: "ID_energy sector_transformer"
- **comment**: Space for an individual comment, e.g. an indication of  which measure this component belongs to.
- **active**: Specifies whether the link shall be included to the model. 0 = inactive, 1 = active. 
- **bus_1**: First bus to which the link is connected. If it is a directed link, this is the input bus.
- **bus_2**: Second bus to which the link is connected. If it is a directed link, this is the output bus.
- **(un)directed**: Specifies whether it is a directed or an undirected link. Input options: "directed", "undirected".
- **efficiency**: Specifies the efficiency of the link. Values between 0 and 1 are allowed entries.
- **variable output costs/(CU/kWh)**: Specifies the efficiency of the first output. Values between 0 and 1 are allowed entries.
- **variable constraint costs/(CU/kWh)**: Only if considering constraints. Costs incurred per kWh referring to the constraint limit set in the "energysystem" sheet.
- **existing capacity/(kW)**: Already installed capacity of the link.
- **min. investment capacity/(kW)**: Minimum, in addition to existing capacity, installable capacity.
- **max. investment capacity/(kW)**: Maximum capacity to be installed.
- **periodical costs/(CU/(kW a))**: Costs incurred per kW for investments within the time horizon.
- **Non-Convex Investment**: Specifies whether the investment capacity should be defined as a mixed-integer variable, i.e. whether the model can decide whether NOTHING OR THE INVESTMENT should be implemented.
- **Fix Investment Costs /(CU/a)**: Fixed costs of non-convex investments (in addition to the periodic costs)

Time Series
=================================================

Within this sheet, time series of components of which no automatically created time series exist, are stored. More 
specifically, these are sinks to which the property "load profile" have been assigned as "timeseries" and sources 
with the "technology" property "timeseries". The following parameters have to be entered:

- **timestamp**: Points in time to which the stored time series are related. Should be within the time horizon defined in the sheet "timesystem".
- **timeseries**: Time series of a sink or a source  which has been assigned the property "timeseries" under the attribute "load profile" or "technology. Time series contain a value between 0 and 1 for each point in time, which indicates the proportion of installed capacity accounted for by the capacity produced at that point in time. In the header line, the name must rather be entered in the format "componentID.fix" if the component enters the power system as a fixed component or it requires two columns in the format "componentID.min" and "componentID.max" if it is an unfixed component. The columns "componentID.min/.max" define the range that the solver can use for its optimisation.

Weather Data
=================================================

If electrical load profiles are simulated with the Richardson tool, heating load profiles with the demandlib or 
photovoltaic systems with the feedinlib, weather data must be stored here. The weather 
data time system should be in conformity with the modelâ€™s time system, defined in the sheet "timesystem".

- **timestamp**: Points in time to which the stored weather data are related. 
- **dhi**: diffuse horizontal irradiance in W/m\ :sup:`2`
- **dirhi**: direct horizontal irradiance in W/m\ :sup:`2`
- **pressure**: air pressure in Pa
- **windspeed**: wind speed, measured at 10 m height, in unit m/s
- **z0**: roughness length of the environment in units m
- **ground_temp**: constant ground temperature at 100 m depth
- **water_temp**: varying water temperature of a river depending on the air temperature
- **groundwater_temp**: constant temperatur of the ground water at 6 - 10 m depth in North Rhine-Westphalia
